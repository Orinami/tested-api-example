# README
This is a simple (though unfinished) API for a support ticketing system. I was building it while learning how to test my Rails APIs using Rspec, Airborne, FactoryGirl etc.

You can read more about testing with Airborne [here](https://chunksofco.de/testing-your-rails-apis-with-airborne-f5689848f4a5#.1utflmp8r).

# Running the Application
Just fork & checkout the source code, & run `bundle install`.
You can run all tests with `rspec`
